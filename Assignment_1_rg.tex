\begin{question}{(22 total points) Linear Regression}

\questiontext{In this question we will fit linear regression models to data.}



%
%
\begin{subquestion}{(3 points) Describe the main properties of the data, focusing on the size, data ranges, and data types.   
}


\begin{answerbox}{10em}
The data set has 50 observations in total. It consists of two attributes revision\_time and exam\_score, both of type float64. 
The revision\_time has a minimum of 2.723 hours and a maximum of 48.011 hours and the exam\_score has a minimum of 14.731 and a maximum of 94.945. 
The average revision\_time of a student is 22.22002 hours and the average exam\_score is 49.91986.


\end{answerbox}



\end{subquestion}




%
%
\begin{subquestion}{(3 points) Fit a linear model to the data so that we can predict \texttt{exam\_score} from \texttt{revision\_time}. 
Report the estimated model parameters $\mathbf{w}$. 
Describe what the parameters represent for this 1D data. 
For this part, you should use the sklearn implementation of \href{https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html}{Linear Regression}.\\
\hint{By default in sklearn \texttt{fit\_intercept = True}. Instead, set \texttt{fit\_intercept = False} and pre-pend $1$ to each value of $x_i$ yourself to create $\boldsymbol{\phi}(x_i) = [1, x_i]$.

\begin{subquestion}{(3 points) Instead of using sklearn, implement the closed-form solution for fitting a linear regression model yourself using numpy array operations.  
Report your code in the answer box.
It should only take a few lines (i.e. <5).\\ 
\hint{Only report the relevant lines for estimating $\mathbf{w}$ e.g. we do not need to see the data loading code. You can write the code in the answer box directly or paste in an image of it. }
}


\begin{answerbox}{20em}
\begin{verbatim}
y = dataset_q1.exam_score.values
exam_scores = np.polyfit(dataset_q1["revision_time"].values, y, 1)
np.polyval(exam_scores[::-1], [y])
w = np.linalg.inv(X.transpose().dot(X)).dot(X.transpose()).dot(y)
\end{verbatim}
\end{answerbox}



\end{subquestion}



%
%
\begin{subquestion}{(3 points) Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common metric used for evaluating the performance of regression models. 
Write out the expression for MSE and list one of its limitations. \\
\hint{For notation, you can use $y$ for the ground truth quantity and $\hat{y}$ (\texttt{\$\textbackslash{}hat\{y\}\$} in latex) in place of the model prediction.}
}


\begin{answerbox}{10em}
MSE = $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}(y_{i} - \hat{y_{i}})^2$


Mean Squared Error is prone to outliers because it uses mean in calculating the error value. 

When calculating the mean value, there is a possibility that it might produce a very large value due to one large outlier which might lead to high errors.
\end{answerbox}



\end{subquestion}


 
%
%
\begin{subquestion}{(3 points) Our next step will be to evaluate the performance of the fitted models using Mean Squared Error (MSE). 
Report the MSE of the data in \texttt{regression\_part1.csv} for your prediction of \texttt{exam\_score}.
You should report the MSE for the linear model fitted using sklearn and the model resulting from your closed-form solution. 
Comment on any differences in their performance. 
}


\begin{answerbox}{10em}
MSE of the sklearn model is $30.9854726145413$, and of closed form solution model is $30.98547261454129$. The difference being in the magnitude of $10^{-14}$, is completely negligible.
\end{answerbox}



\end{subquestion}




%
%
\begin{subquestion}{(4 points) Assume that the optimal value of $w_0$ is $20$, it is not but let's assume so for now. 
Create a plot where you vary $w_1$ from $-2$ to $+2$ on the horizontal axis, and report the Mean Squared Error on the vertical axis for each setting of $\mathbf{w} = [w_0, w_1]$ across the dataset. 
Describe the resulting plot. Where is its minimum? Is this value to be expected?\\ 
\hint{You can try 100 values of $w_1$ i.e. \texttt{w1 = np.linspace(-2,2, 100)}.}
}


\begin{answerbox}{35em}
CHANGE IT:(APURV)

The plot is in the shape of an half-parabola, if we extend the x-axis we will see the full parabolic graph. The minima of the plot is at $w1 = 1.3535353535353538$. This can be explained by its closeness to the actual value of $\beta = 1.44114091$, which we found when we fitted our model. The slight discrepancy can be explained by choosing a non optimal value for $w0$ instead of $17.89768026$.

\begin{question}{(18 total points) Nonlinear Regression}

\questiontext{In this question we will tackle regression using basis functions.}




%
%
\begin{subquestion}{(5 points) Fit four different polynomial regression models to the data  by varying the degree of polynomial features used i.e. $M = 1$ to $4$.
For example, $M=3$ means that $\boldsymbol{\phi}(x_i) = [1, x_i, x_i^2, x_i^3]$.
Plot the resulting models on the same plot and also include the input data.\\
\hint{
 You can again use the sklearn implementation of \href{https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html}{Linear Regression} and you can also use \href{https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html}{PolynomialFeatures} to generate the polynomial features. Again, set \texttt{fit\_intercept = False}.}

\end{subquestion}


%
%
\begin{subquestion}{(3 points) Create a bar plot where you display the Mean Squared Error of each of the four different polynomial regression models from the previous question.}


\begin{answerbox}{35em}
The first bar is for M1, second for M2, third for M3 and the fourth for M4 as shown in the plot below:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/2b}
\end{center}
\end{answerbox}



\end{subquestion}


%
%
\begin{subquestion}{(4 points) Comment on the fit and Mean Squared Error values of the $M=3$ and $M=4$ polynomial regression models. 
Do they result in the same or different performance? 
Based on these results, which model would you choose?}


\begin{answerbox}{15em}
If we look at the bar plot in Q2(c), the $M=3$ and the $M=4$ models have the same performance. Their fit can be seen in the plot to produce the same outputs, and hence they have the same MSE. Thus, any of the two models can be chosen.
\end{answerbox}



\end{subquestion}



%
%
\begin{subquestion}{(6 points) Instead of using polynomial basis functions, in this final part we will use another type of basis function - radial basis functions (RBF). 
Specifically, we will define $\boldsymbol{\phi}(x_i) = [1, rbf(x_i; c_1, \alpha), rbf(x_i; c_2, \alpha), rbf(x_i; c_3, \alpha), rbf(x_i; c_4, \alpha)]$, where $rbf(x; c, \alpha) =  \exp(-0.5(x-c)^2 / \alpha^2)$ is an RBF kernel with center $c$ and width $\alpha$. Note that in this example, we are using the same width $\alpha$ for each RBF, but different centers for each.\\ 
Let $c_1=-4.0$, $c_2=-2.0$, $c_3=2.0$, and $c_4=4.0$ and plot the resulting nonlinear predictions using the \texttt{regression\_part2.csv} dataset for $\alpha \in \{0.2, 100, 1000\}$. 
You can plot all three results on the same figure.
Comment on the impact of larger or smaller values of $\alpha$.
}


\begin{answerbox}{35em}

The following graph becomes smoother and more parabolic with larger values of alpha. Whereas, with smaller values of alpha, the graph becomes less smooth and less parabolic.

\begin{question}{(26 total points) Decision Trees}

\questiontext{In this question we will train a classifier to predict if a person is smiling or not.}




%
%
\begin{subquestion}{(4 points) Load the data, taking care to separate the target binary class label we want to predict, \texttt{smiling}, from the input attributes. 
Summarise the main properties of both the training and test splits. 
}


\begin{answerbox}{12em}
CHANGE IT:(APURV)

The train dataset has 4800 observations, and the test dataset has 1200 observations. This a traditional 75\%-25\% split of the whole dataset to train the model. Each observation is composed of 68 (x, y) pairs of points.
\end{answerbox}



\end{subquestion}


%
%
\begin{subquestion}{(4 points) Even though the input attributes are high dimensional, they actually consist of a set of 2D coordinates representing points on the faces of each person in the dataset. 
Create a scatter plot of the average location for each 2D coordinate. One for (i) smiling and (ii) one not smiling faces. 
For instance, in the case of smiling faces, you would average each of the rows where \texttt{smiling = 1}. 
You can plot both on the same figure, but use different colors for each of the two cases. 
Comment on any difference you notice between the two sets of points. \\
\hint{Your plot should contain two faces.}
}


\begin{answerbox}{35em}
The main difference in the scatter plot is that in the smiling scatter plot, the face formed has its mouth open and lips raised. In other words, the points are scattered more as compared to the not smiling face. This also leads its chin to be slightly lower and eyes a bit more inclined compared to the not smiling plot.

\end{subquestion}


%
%
\begin{subquestion}{(2 points) 
There are different measures that can be used in decision trees when evaluating the quality of a split. 
What measure of purity at a node does the \href{https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html}{DecisionTreeClassifier} in sklearn use for classification by default? 
What is the advantage, if any, of using this measure compared to entropy? 
}


\begin{answerbox}{10em}
The default measure of the value of purity of DecisionTreeClassifier in sklearn is called the "Gini Index". The advantage of using "Gini Index" compared to entropy is that it is is easier to calculate and computationally less expensive.

\end{answerbox}



\end{subquestion}


%
%
\begin{subquestion}{(3 points) 
One of the hyper-parameters of a decision tree classifier is the maximum depth of the tree. 
What impact does smaller or larger values of this parameter have? Give one potential problem for small values and two for large values. 
}


\begin{answerbox}{10em}
CHANGE IT:(APURV)
The max\_depth parameter sets how deep the tree can grow and hence how complicated our model will be. Increasing the value of max\_depth means we have a higher training accuracy, however we have to be careful not to overfit on the training data. If the max\_depth is really high we observe our testing accuracy goes down. We need to find a sweet spot in between to have the best possible model. For small values we may not have enough distinguishing features to make an accurate model. For large values, the model becomes complicated and we will overfit on training data.
\end{answerbox}



\end{subquestion}


%
%
\begin{subquestion}{(6 points) 
Train three different decision tree classifiers with a maximum depth of 2, 8, and 20 respectively.
Report the maximum depth, the training accuracy (in \%), and the test accuracy (in \%) for each of the three trees.
Comment on which model is best and why it is best. \\
\hint{Set \texttt{random\_state = 2001} and use the \texttt{predict()} method of the \href{https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html}{DecisionTreeClassifier} so that you do not need to set a threshold on the output predictions.
You can set the maximum depth of the decision tree using the \texttt{max\_depth} hyper-parameter.}
}


\begin{answerbox}{20em}
The training accuracy for maximum depth = 2 is 0.7947916666666667 and the test accuracy is 0.7816666666666666.

The training accuracy for maximum depth = 8 is 0.9335416666666667 and the test accuracy is 0.8408333333333333.

The training accuracy for maximum depth = 20 is 1.0 and the test accuracy is 0.815.

The model with max\_depth=8 is the best amongst the 3. We have the highest test accuracy, and much lower complexity than the model with 20 layers.
\end{answerbox}



\end{subquestion}


%
%
\begin{subquestion}{(5 points) 
Report the names of the top three most important attributes, in order of importance, according to the Gini importance from \href{https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html}{DecisionTreeClassifier}. 
Does the one with the highest importance make sense in the context of this classification task? \\
\hint{Use the trained model with \texttt{max\_depth = 8} and again set  \texttt{random\_state = 2001}.}
}


\begin{answerbox}{10em}
The three most important attributes in order of importance are are `x50, y48 and y29`.
The one with the highest importance does make sense in the context of this classification task.
